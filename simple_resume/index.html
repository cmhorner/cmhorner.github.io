					<h3>Profile</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="span9 ">
					<p>I am enthusiastic and enthralled with coding, thrilled with the prospect of each new avenue and learning experience.  I will fit seamlessly into any great company culture and work to be both a leader and a quality team player.  I have great passion for fun people, interesting projects and the pursuit of perfection.<br /> 
          While new to the field, I have displayed a willingness to learn, work everyday through the challenges and network with people who can mentor me.  Each day in front of a computer is a new challenge and a new personal best. In nearly 20 years as a cook and chef almost 7 of those were spent in some type of management position.  I have welcomed responsibility in all forms and enjoy watching others succeed. I believe that companies are defined, not just by their output but also by the culture that surrounds them.  With that in mind, I offer a creative and enthusiasic mindset.  I am family and community oriented and enjoy teamwork and problem solving with others.</p>

					<h3>Interests</h3>
				</header>
				<div class="span9">
					<h4>Cooking</h4>
					<p>As an avid traveler and reader I have amassed a wealth of experiences and I love reliving my travels in the kitchen by trying new recipes or sharing food with friends and family.</p>
					<h4>Reading</h4>
					<p>My mother was a reading teacher and from a young age I was lucky enough to be given the passion for a good book.  I'll read anything from history to sci-fi to epic fantasy as I think the varied experiences help develop a more creative and expansive mind.</p>
					<h4>Family</h4>
					<p>Above all things, I love to spend time with my family and my pets.  There is nothing more centering and calming than a good meal and conversation with the people you care about.</p>
